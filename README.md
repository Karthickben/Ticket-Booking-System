# Ticket-Booking-System
The Application has been implemented using the Microservice Architecture. This system is decomposed into below four microservices. Each microsevices is an individual rest service and can communicate with other services.
   
   1) User Micro Service:  Handles customer/admim details. 
   2) Movie Micro Service: Handles movie details.
   3) Theatre Micro Service: Handles theatre, screen and show related details.
   4) Booking Micro Service: Handles ticket booking and cancellation.
   
   * API Gateway: Zuul server will be used as the API gateway and it routes all the clientâ€™s requests to the individual services.
   * Service Registry: Eureka server has been used as the registry server. 
   * Cloud config server: All the common properties of microservices will be stored centrally in Git. Cloud config sever helps microservices to fetch the properties from GIT https://github.com/Karthickben/TicketBookingConfigs

To get started you can simply clone this repository using git:
        
        git clone https://github.com/Karthickben/Ticket-Booking-System.git
        
## Build an executable JAR
You can run the application from the command line using:

        mvn spring-boot:run
        Or you can build a single executable JAR file that contains all the necessary dependencies, classes, and resources with:

        mvn clean package
        Then you can run the JAR file with:

        java -jar target/*.jar
        Instead of mvn you can also use the maven-wrapper ./mvnw to ensure you have everything necessary to run the Maven build.
